## Baseball graphs

This was a cool project to plot the season statistics for the Richmond Dukes baseball team in London, who are managed by my friend Alvin. You can see the finished graphs [here](https://www.alvinmichael.com/baseball/richmond-dukes-2022-season-in-review) and also check out the code in the [Github repo](https://github.com/joeshaw824/richmond_dukes_baseball) if you're interested.
