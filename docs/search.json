I personally have felt both those things at various points in my coding journey.\nThis is a shame, because coding is a wonderful, fun, creative experience which should be open to everyone. Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein have discussed, in their excellent book “Data Feminism”, how common preconceptions about what a “coder” looks like are the product of historical biases and structural inequality. In reality, coding is for everyone.\nSo if you want to learn to code, then coding is for you."

    "text": "Can you make it fun? Or useful? Or both?\nFor me, a hard part of learning to code was not just understanding technical details or abstract concepts - it was persevering when I was frustrated and things didn’t work.\nI found that the easiest way to ensure I kept going through the frustration was to make the process fun or useful, and ideally both at the same time.\nFor example, when I was learning how to make plots in R, I decided to make performance plots for my friend Alvin’s baseball team, the Richmond Dukes. Alvin then kindly included them in his end-of-season review, and taught me a lot about the statistics of baseball (something I had never come across before, but now love). This was a super fun project which taught me some cool stuff about generating plots with R."

    "text": "Try explaining things in your own words\nWhen I started learning to code, I struggled with the way that things were named.\nThere were so many baffling new terms, acronyms and phrases which made it hard for me to understand what I was meant to be doing (and this was added on top of the confusion of trying to learn a programming language).\nMany of the terms I was coming across seemed deliberately weird: this is because the culture of coding can be quite quite playful - people enjoy giving things funny names or including in-jokes or pop-culture references.\nOne good example would the python programming language, which is named, not after a snake, but after the British comedy group Monty Python (if you’ve never watched any, click here for a example of a Monty Python sketch). There’s no link between Monty Python and coding, other than the designer of python, Guido van Rossum, liked Monty Python.\nThe approach which helped me make some sense of all this was to create my own glossary of new words, where I could write down my explanation of what things meant.\nI decided I would put every word I didn’t know into this dictionary, no matter how “simple” or “obvious”, and explain them in a way which made sense to me.\nMy glossary has grown over time to now include over 300 definitions. You can download it here if you’d like some inspiration on how to make your own glossary. I’m still adding to my glossary, and you can see the most recent version here."

    "text": "Combining code and text can be really helpful\nThe formal name for combining code and explanatory text within the same document is “literate programming”, and I have found it very helpful when learning to code.\nThis is because I can write explanations of what I am doing (or what I think I’m doing …) and then intersperse the explanations with small chunks of code.\nThere are various options for literate programming, but Quarto is a particularly useful tool, which you can use with multiple languages, including R.\nThis post is actually written in a Quarto document (as is my coding glossary), and therefore is an example of literate programming: below is some fun code that makes a fun plot.\n\n\nClick here to see the code\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = seq(1:100)) |&gt;\n  mutate(y = x^3)\n\nhappy_plot &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1, colour = \"blue\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),\n  axis.text = element_blank(),\n  axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 18)) +\n  labs(x = \"Time spent with R\",\n  y = \"Joe's happiness\")\n\nhappy_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCombining text and code can be empowering if you want to use coding in your job. For example, say you need to do some analysis and then write a report for your boss.\nOne way would be to do some analysis in a Microsoft Excel file, make a plot, then copy and paste the plot into a Microsoft Word document and write your report.\nA different way is to combine the analysis and report within the same document using literate programming.\nThis means that if you need to change some part of the analysis, you can edit one file and then both your analysis and final report will automatically update. I’m a huge fan of this approach, and I use it every day for writing documentation for genetic tests."

He explained the rules of baseball to me, and I went along to see the Dukes play one Sunday afternoon. Alvin then mentioned he was writing a review article of the team’s performance that season, and needed some nice plots to illustrate how the team was improving.\nSo I got access to the team’s statistics and made some fun graphs in ggplot2, with the club’s colours for the colour scheme and their logo added in.

This page lists the tests I have worked on so far in my career, starting with the most recent.\nDeveloping and delivering genetic tests is a joint effort between clinical scientists, bioinformaticians, technologists, technicians, data-scientists, clinicians and administrative staff. All of the projects listed below were collaborations with many wonderful colleagues without whom these projects would not have succeeded.\n\n\nChromosome-arm-level Copy Number Variant Detection in Solid Cancers\nIn this project we validated detection of copy number variants which impact entire chromosome arms, which are increasingly used in the diagnosis and stratification of brain tumours. This included the recurrent 1p19q co-deletion and simultaneous gain of chromosome 7 with loss of chromosome 10 (+7/-10).\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: May 2025-Jan 2026\nLocation: Manchester Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: QIAseq next generation sequencing\nCode: R and Quarto\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to create interactive plots in R and python using the plotly package\nHow to combine multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) data and next generation sequencing (NGS) data in R\n\n\n\nDeletions, LOH and Ploidy Detection in Solid Cancers\nThis project was the third section of a broader project to validate copy number variant detection for solid cancers at the North West GLH. It was the most technically complex validation I’ve done so far, involving over 150 samples, 47 different genes and 4 different laboratory methods, with investigation of gene deletions, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and different chromosomal ploidy states.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Nov 2024-April 2025\nLocation: Manchester Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: QIAseq next generation sequencing\nCode: R and Quarto\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to create my first R package: foldchanger\nHow to perform automated code testing with testthat\nHow to perform validation comparisons across multiple techniques and data layouts, including whole genome sequencing, droplet digital PCR, short tandem repeat PCR and NGS\n\n\n\nAmplifications of 9 Oncogenes in Diverse Cancers\nThis project built on my previous validation of ERBB2 amplifications, adding a further 8 genes: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, MET, MDM2 MYC, MYCN and SMO. These genes are important for prognosis and treatment planning in many different cancer types.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Apr 2024-Nov 2024\nLocation: Manchester Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: QIAseq next generation sequencing\nCode: R\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to build a shiny app for quality monitoring\nHow to render full documentation and analysis with R and Quarto into a Word template\nHow to manipulate whole genome sequencing HTML results using rvest\n\n\n\nERBB2 Amplifications in Solid Cancers\nThis project was to detect amplifications of the ERBB2 (HER2) gene in solid tumour samples, focusing on lung, colorectal and brain cancers. ERBB2 is an important gene in many cancer types, and is targeted by several medications including trastuzumab (Herceptin).\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Dec 2023-Apr 2024\nLocation: Manchester Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: QIAseq next generation sequencing\nCode: R\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to create CNV plots with embedded gene, exon and primer locations\nHow to combine R and Quarto for analysis\nHow to perform limit of detection experiments with reference materials\n\n\n\nGenomic Instability Testing for Ovarian Cancer\nIn this project I validated a new bioinformatics pipeline for detection of genomic instability in ovarian cancer, which was developed by the company SeqOne Genomics. Accurate detection of genomic instability is necessary for identifying optimum-responders to the anti-cancer drug olaparib (Lynparza®). This workflow is now in diagnostic service, and the results are used to plan patient treatment.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Sept 2023-Dec 2023\nLocation: Manchester Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS)\nCode: R\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to analyse sWGS data\nHow to query an SQL database with dbplyr using an ODBC connection\nHow to parse information from PDFs with pdftools using regular expressions and raw strings\n\n\n\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia type 36\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is a very rare neurological disorder caused by a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the NOP56 gene, with fewer than 200 patients reported in the literature. I optimised a repeat-primed PCR protocol and validated it on a cohort of samples tested via whole genome sequencing with the ExpansionHunter algorithm. This diagnostic service is, to my knowledge, the first in the world for this condition.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Nov 2022-July 2023\nLocation: University College London Hospital Neurogenetics Department\nTechnique: repeat-primed PCR and flanking PCR\nCode: R\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to design repeat-primed PCR primers\nHow to optimise repeat-primed PCRs\nHow to integrate a literature review into a validation document\n\n\n\nRFC1-Disorder Testing\nRFC1-disorder is a neurological disorder caused by repeat expansions in the RFC1 gene, and was first reported in 2019 by Dr Andrea Cortese’s research group at the UCLH Institute for Neurology. For this project I developed a diagnostic service for RFC1 expansions by modifying the available research protocol, and successfully added RFC1 testing to the NHS National Genomic Test Directory.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Jan 2022-July 2023\nLocation: University College London Hospital Neurogenetics Department\nTechnique: multiple repeat-primed PCRs and flanking PCR\nCode: R\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to fully optimise a flanking PCR to detect large amplicons\nHow to apply to the National Genomic Test Directory for new test indication\nHow to integrate multiple PCRs into a single workflow for increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness\n\n\n\nMosaicism Detection for Rare Skin Disorders\nThe aim of this project was to confirm mosaic sequence variants for rare skin disorders using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The main challenges were that the variants were sometimes present in 1% of the sample or lower, the DNA quantities from skin biopsies were limited, and many of the variants were only found in a single patient. The solution was to use R to collate all the ddPCR data for multiple assays and establish uniform thresholds for background normal variation. The technique was then brought into diagnostic service, and over 100 reports were issued in the first 6 months.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Oct 2021-March 2022\nLocation: North London Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: ddPCR\nCode: R\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to set data-driven analysis thresholds for ddPCR\nHow to use RMarkdown to generate validation plots and tables\nHow to automatically audit clinical services using RMarkdown scripts\n\n\n\nNon-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis for Sickle Cell Disease and Rare Genetic Conditions\nIn this project I developed a ddPCR test for sickle cell disease which could diagnose the condition prenatally using only a maternal blood sample. The project was then expanded to developing bespoke ddPCR assays for rare genetic conditions with different inheritance patterns. The correct prediction rate was optimised to 98% in comparison with invasive testing, but the presence of 2 incorrect results prevented the implementation of the method as a diagnostic service, and we published our findings in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: publication\nTiming: September 2019-January 2022\nLocation: North London Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: droplet digital PCR\nCode: R and JAGS\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to write an original research paper\nHow to write code in R using tidyverse packages\nHow to optimise ddPCR assays\n\n\n\nMyotonic Dystrophy Type 1\nThis was my first validation project, which I began as a trainee clinical scientist. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, and testing for this condition is a core requirement for genetics laboratories in England. I was asked to validate the test at the North London Genomic Laboratory Hub as part of my clinical scientist training. The validation successfully passed external evaluation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) and went into diagnostic service.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: July 2018-Jan 2020\nLocation: North London Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: repeat-primed PCR\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to write a validation document to the standards of ISO:15189\nHow to calculate mobility shifts in capillary electrophoresis using GeneMarker\nHow to write standard operating procedures for wet lab work and analysis"
