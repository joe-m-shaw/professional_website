    "text": "Introduction\nI specialise in making new genetic tests for clinical laboratories. This page lists the tests I have developed so far in my career, starting with the most recent. All of these projects were collaborations with many wonderful colleagues who I am greatly indebted to.\n\n\nGenomic Instability Testing for Ovarian Cancer\nIn this project I validated a new bioinformatics pipeline for detection of genomic instability in ovarian cancer, which was developed by the company SeqOne Genomics. Accurate detection of genomic instability is necessary for identifying optimum-responders to the anti-cancer drug olaparib (Lynparza®). This workflow is now in diagnostic service, and the results are used to plan patient treatment.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Sept 2023-Dec 2023\nLocation: Manchester Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS)\nCodebase: R\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to query an SQL database with R using an ODBC connection\nHow to parse information from PDFs\nHow to analyse sWGS data\n\n\n\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia type 36\nSpinocerebellar Ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is a very rare neurological disorder caused by a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the NOP56 gene, with fewer than 200 patients reported in the literature. I optimised a repeat-primed PCR protocol and validated it on a cohort of samples tested via whole genome sequencing with the ExpansionHunter algorithm. This diagnostic service is, to my knowledge, the first in the world for this condition.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Nov 2022-July 2023\nLocation: University College London Hospital Neurogenetics Department\nTechnique: repeat-primed PCR and flanking PCR\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to design repeat-primed PCR primers\nHow to use optimise repeat-primed PCRs\nHow to integrate a literature review into a validation document\n\n\n\nRFC1-Disorder Testing\nRFC1-disorder is a neurological disorder caused by repeat expansions in the RFC1 gene, and was first reported in 2019 by Dr Andrea Cortese’s research group at the UCLH Institute for Neurology. For this project I developed a diagnostic service for RFC1 expansions by modifying the available research protocol, and successfully added RFC1 testing to the NHS National Genomic Test Directory.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Jan 2022-July 2023\nLocation: University College London Hospital Neurogenetics Department\nTechnique: multiple repeat-primed PCRs and flanking PCR\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to fully optimise a flanking PCR to detect large amplicons\nHow to apply to the National Genomic Test Directory for new test indication\nHow to integrate multiple PCRs into a single workflow for increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness\n\n\n\nMosaicism Detection for Rare Skin Disorders\nThe aim of this project was to confirm mosaic sequence variants for rare skin disorders using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The main challenges were that the variants were sometimes present in 1% of the sample or lower, the DNA quantities from skin biopsies were limited, and many of the variants were only found in a single patient. The solution was to use R to collate all the ddPCR data for multiple assays and establish uniform thresholds for background normal variation. The technique was then brought into diagnostic service, and over 100 reports were issued in the first 6 months.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: Oct 2021-March 2022\nLocation: North London Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: ddPCR\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to set data-driven analysis thresholds for ddPCR\nHow to use RMarkdown to generate validation plots and tables\nHow to automatically audit clinical services using R Markdown scripts\n\n\n\nNon-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis for Sickle Cell Disease and Rare Genetic Conditions\nIn this project I developed a ddPCR test for sickle cell disease which could diagnose the condition prenatally using only a maternal blood sample. The project was then expanded to developing bespoke ddPCR assays for rare genetic conditions with different inheritance patterns. The correct prediction rate was optimised to 98% in comparison with invasive testing, but the presence of 2 incorrect results prevented the implementation of the method as a diagnostic service, and we published our findings in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: publication\nTiming: September 2019-January 2022\nLocation: North London Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: droplet digital PCR\nCodebase: R and JAGS\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to write an original research paper\nHow to write code in R\nHow to optimise ddPCR assays\n\n\n\nMyotonic Dystrophy Type 1\nThis was my first validation project, which I began as a trainee clinical scientist. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, and testing for this condition is a core requirement for genetics laboratories in England. I was asked to validate the test at the North London Genomic Laboratory Hub as part of my clinical scientist training. The validation successfully passed external evaluation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) and went into diagnostic service.\nProject Overview\nOutcome: diagnostic service\nTiming: July 2018-Jan 2020\nLocation: North London Genomic Laboratory Hub\nTechnique: repeat-primed PCR\nSkills I learned\n\nHow to write a validation document to the standards of ISO:15189\nHow to calculate mobility shifts in capillary electrophoresis using GeneMarker\nHow to write standard operating procedures for wet lab work and analysis"
