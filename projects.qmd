# Introduction

I specialise in developing new genetic tests for clinical laboratories. 
This page lists the tests I have worked on so far in my career, starting with the most recent.

Developing and delivering genetic tests is a joint effort between clinical scientists, bioinformaticians, technologists, technicians, data-scientists, clinicians and administrative staff.
All of the projects listed below were collaborations with many wonderful colleagues without whom these projects would not have succeeded.

# Chromosome-arm-level Copy Number Variant Detection in Solid Cancers

In this project we validated detection of copy number variants which impact entire chromosome arms, which are increasingly used in the diagnosis and stratification of brain tumours. 
This included the recurrent 1p19q co-deletion and simultaneous gain of chromosome 7 with loss of chromosome 10 (+7/-10).

# Deletions, LOH and Ploidy Detection in Solid Cancers

This project was the third section of a broader project to validate copy number variant detection for solid cancers at the North West GLH. It was the most technically complex validation I've done so far, involving over 150 samples, 47 different genes and 4 different laboratory methods, with investigation of gene deletions, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and different chromosomal ploidy states.

# Genomic Instability Testing for Ovarian Cancer

In this project I validated a new bioinformatics pipeline for detection of genomic instability in ovarian cancer, which was developed by the company [SeqOne Genomics](https://seqone.com/). Accurate detection of genomic instability is necessary for identifying optimum-responders to the anti-cancer drug olaparib (Lynparza®). This workflow is now in diagnostic service, and the results are used to plan patient treatment.

# Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 36

Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 36 ([SCA36](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25593102/)) is a very rare neurological disorder caused by a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the *NOP56* gene, with fewer than 200 patients reported in the literature. I optimised a repeat-primed PCR protocol and validated it on a cohort of samples tested via whole genome sequencing with the [ExpansionHunter](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31134279/) algorithm. This diagnostic service is, to my knowledge, the first in the world for this condition.

# *RFC1*-Disorder Testing

*RFC1*-disorder is a neurological disorder caused by repeat expansions in the *RFC1* gene, and was first [reported in 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30926972/) by Dr Andrea Cortese's research group at the UCLH Institute for Neurology. For this project I developed a diagnostic service for *RFC1* expansions by modifying the available research protocol, and successfully added *RFC1* testing to the [NHS National Genomic Test Directory](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories/).

- How to integrate multiple PCRs into a single workflow for increased efficiency and cost-effectiveness

# Mosaicism Detection for Rare Skin Disorders

The aim of this project was to confirm mosaic sequence variants for rare skin disorders using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The main challenges were that the variants were sometimes present in 1% of the sample or lower, the DNA quantities from skin biopsies were limited, and many of the variants were only found in a single patient. The solution was to use R to collate all the ddPCR data for multiple assays and establish uniform thresholds for background normal variation. The technique was then brought into diagnostic service, and over 100 reports were issued in the first 6 months.

# Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis for Sickle Cell Disease and Rare Genetic Conditions

In this project I developed a ddPCR test for sickle cell disease which could diagnose the condition prenatally using only a maternal blood sample. The project was then expanded to developing bespoke ddPCR assays for rare genetic conditions with different inheritance patterns. The correct prediction rate was optimised to 98% in comparison with invasive testing, but the presence of 2 incorrect results prevented the implementation of the method as a diagnostic service, and we [published our findings](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36760169/) in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis.

# Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1

This was my first validation project, which I began as a trainee clinical scientist. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by a triplet repeat expansion in the *DMPK* gene, and testing for this condition is a core requirement for genetics laboratories in England. I was asked to validate the test at the North London Genomic Laboratory Hub as part of my clinical scientist training. The validation successfully passed external evaluation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) and went into diagnostic service.
