My job is to make new tests for genetic laboratories. These are the lab tests I have developed so far in my career, starting with the most recent.

# Genomic Instability Testing for Ovarian Cancer

This was a project to validate the SeqOne HRD test for ovarian cancer. This is the test that allows access to the drug olaparib. Until this project, samples were shipped to the USA for testing by Myriad Genetics.

[**Overview**]{.underline}

**Outcome:** clinical service

**Timing:** Sept 2023-Dec 2023

**Location:** Manchester Genomic Laboratory Hub

**Technique:** shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS)

**Code:** [Github repo](https://github.com/joeshaw824/homologous_recombination_deficiency)

[**Skills I learned**]{.underline}

- How to query an SQL database with R using an ODBC connection.
- How to parse information from PDFs.
- How to analyse sWGS data.

# Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 36

Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 36 (SCA36) is a very rare neurological disorder caused by a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the *NOP56* gene, with fewer than 200 patients reported in the literature. To my knowledge, no diagnostic service existed in the world prior to this project. 

[**Overview**]{.underline}

**Outcome:** clinical service

**Timing:** Nov 2022-July 2023

**Location:** University College London Hospital Neurogenetics Department

**Technique:** repeat-primed PCR and flanking PCR

[**Skills I learned**]{.underline}

- How to design repeat-primed PCR primers
- How to use optimise repeat-primed PCRs 
- How to integrate a literature review into a validation document

# *RFC1*-Disorder Testing

*RFC1*-disorder is a neurological disorder caused by repeat expansions in the *RFC1* gene, and was first [reported in 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30926972/) by Dr Andrea Cortese's research group at the UCLH Institute for Neurology. For this project we developed a diagnostic service for *RFC1* expansions by modifying the research protocol, and we successfully added *RFC1* testing to the [NHS National Genomic Test Directory](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/national-genomic-test-directories/).

[**Overview**]{.underline}

**Outcome:** clinical service

**Timing:** Jan 2022-July 2023

**Location:** University College London Hospital Neurogenetics Department

**Technique:** multiple repeat-primed PCRs and flanking PCR

[**Skills I learned**]{.underline}

- How to apply to the National Genomic Test Directory for new test indication.
- How to fully optimise a flanking PCR to detect large amplicons.

# Mosaicism Detection for Rare Skin Disorders

At the Great Ormond Street Hospital genetics lab, low level genetic variants detected by next generation sequencing needed to be confirmed by ddPCR prior to reporting, to be sure that they weren't false positives. This was challenging because the variants were sometimes present at 1% or lower, the DNA quantities from skin biopsies were limited, and there were too few samples to generate individualised thresholds for each ddPCR assay. The solution was to use R to collate all the ddPCR data for multiple confirmatory assays and establish uniform thresholds for background normal variation. This was a really fun project to work on.
